# Google Sprint for ClubHub
Prototype Link: https://40k2v0.axshare.com/#g=1&p=app_store
Google Sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. Developed at Google Ventures, it’s a “greatest hits” of business strategy, innovation, behavior science, design thinking, and more—packaged into a battle-tested process that any team can use.

Working together in a sprint, we shortcut the endless-debate cycle and compressed months of time into a single week. Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, we got clear data from a realistic prototype. We planned our sprint with one big question in mind: How can we improve student experience by focusing on students' social life at NJIT?  

In the sprint, several roles were assigned:

### Facilitator
Mousa Ahmadi
### Decider
Emmalyn Ramos
### Sprinters
Melissa Alzate, Nuriman Tjiptarto, Shehab Ibrahim

# Monday  

On Monday, we had structured discussions to create a path for our sprint week. We started at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, we made a map of the challenge. Finally, we picked a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that we could solve in one week.

# Tuesday

After a full day of understanding the problem and choosing a target for our sprint, on Tuesday, we got to focus on solutions. The day started with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to remix and improve. Then, each person will sketched, following a four-step process that emphasized critical thinking over artistry. We also began planning Friday’s customer test.

# Wednesday

On Wednesday, we started a stack of solutions from Tuesday and critiqued each solution, and decided which ones had the best chance of achieving our long-term goal. Then, we took the winning scenes from our sketches and weaved them into a storyboard: a step-by-step plan for our prototype.

### Sticky Decision

# Thursday

We turned our storyboard into a prototype. We focused on the customer-facing surface of your product or service, we finished our prototype in just 8 hours. We also made sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script. Melissa Alzate and Nuriman Tjiptarto were assigned as the **prototypers**; Emmalyn Ramos as the **writer**; Shehab Ibrahim as the **asset collector**; and Mousa Ahmadi as the **stitcher**.

# Friday

We interviewed users and learned by watching them react to your prototype. This test made the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, we knew how far we had to go, and we knew just what to do next.
